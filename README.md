SpaceX / Collective Health / One Medical - Cost of Care Study

Next Steps
Collective (Sanjay) to conduct initial explorations on feasibility, sensitivity of initial study design parameters; suggest study period based on available data
Initial study design parameters, each to be tuned:
Eligibility requirement of continuous enrollment and E&M visit from any provider in the last 12 months
OM attribution through E&M visit with One Medical + 12 month flag
Episode attribution through threshold of visits for a given Dx
Propensity score matching / coarsened exact matching to create study cohorts (either person-level if calendar year analysis, or person-month otherwise)
Difference-in-difference analysis with related statistical tests
MH/PT episode identification through visits to OM for the given Dx
Collective / OM to review, build study plan for base work; create initial scope for additional work 
Additional work: Longitudinal analyses, case studies
Sanjay - Can you suggest a couple times when it will work for you to review the content in the first bullet for this? If possible, anything you can send over in advance will help us be informed for that conversation
OM to share:
Unique combination of NPI / Tax ID should be used to identify OM claims 
Pasted below - other vendors have occasionally had issues with these; let us know if there's anything unexpected and we'll coordinate
Both the Tax ID and NPI are needed; in certain markets, we share a Tax ID with our health system partners and the group NPI is needed to delineate
Virtual claims data
Sanjay - Let us know what fields are essential here? We'll follow up with our legal team to see if a direct Box space will work
OM to huddle internally and share back study plan for impact on member health, and member experience - will be a part of the overall whitepaper

Key Notes
Base key outcome variables vs. control
PEPM by service type (difference-in-difference)
Utilization rates by service type (difference-in-difference)
Episode-based cost analyses for MH and PT
Occupational health claims are not in scope - PT will not include (thanks, Eun Yeong!)
CH will, if available, provide benchmarks on key outcome variables for onsites in general to compare against OM onsite offering
